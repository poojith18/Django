1)start project

django-admin startproject firstproject

2)start application

python manage.py startapp testapp

3)add this application to the project in settings.py file to INSTALLED_APPS

'testapp'

4)define view function inside views.py

def hello_world_view(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1> Hello World </h1>')

5)define URL pattern for our view function inside urls.py

path('hello/', views.hello_world_view)

6)runserver

python manage.py runserver

7)send request

http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello

Rules:

1)We can have multiple views in single application

2) We can have multiple applications in a single project. But problem in urls.py because of importing views from different
applications as below(Overriding).

from greetingapp import views
from timeapp import views

we can solve by using aliasing or explicitly stating as below.

from greetingapp import views as v1
from timeapp import views as v2

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('greeting/', v1.greetings_view),
    path('time/', v2.time_info_view),
]

or

from greetingapp.views import greetings_view
from timeapp.views import time_info_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('greeting/', greetings_view),
    path('time/', time_info_view),
]

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Single application can have multiple view functions, let say 100 view functions --> 100 url patterns in (urls.py).
But ghe bigger problem is urls.py is in project level as application reusability is gping down.

Because if you want to use the same application in other project we can copy that application easily but we also want 
to search for that project related urls in urls.py for copying  --> Maintainenance is going down and it's tough to check.

so we have to define url patterns at application level instead of project level. we can do this by creating a seperate 
urls.py file at application level and link it to project level (urls.py).
